#### What’s worse than finals? 

A) Packing up your college dorm  
B) Moving all your belongings  
C) Figuring out the logistics of how to pack and move  
D) All of the above   

If you’re moving in or out of your college dorm or apartment, we know the dread is worse than prepping for that History 101 presentation that’s worth half of your grade. Except, you can’t cram this into an all nighter.

It doesn’t matter if you’re moving to or from college, in-state or out-of-state, college moving can be a hectic time. 
Moving is a major life milestone and the first move is typically heading off to college. This should be an exciting experience, not a stressful one. 
While you’re busy trying to juggle your class schedules, navigate your financial aid, work a job (or 2), and maintain friendships, the added responsibility of moving can often be too much for anyone to handle. 
This doesn’t just happen once and it’s over. On average, moving in and out of college will occur four times for a college student before they earn their diploma. It’s an additional, unnecessary stress that you take on.
